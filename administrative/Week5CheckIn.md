# Week #5 Check In

## 1a)  Major activities/milestones planned for this week (in the timeline that you had going into the start of the week).

* Completed basic feature engineering (UPDATED)
* Completed basic model implementation (UPDATED)
* Completed data and model analysis


## 1b)  Major activities/milestones accomplished this week (note: this may or may not actually be what was stated in 1a -- that's okay, as long as you're making progress and learning!).

* Lowell completed the statistical comparison of the models
* Lowell also started the creation of the presentation
* The new accuracy scores for each of the models are (predicting next day avalanche danger, last check-in we were predicting current day avalanche danger)
  * Decision Trees: Accuracy = 
  * Random Forest: Accuracy = 
  * Extra Trees: Accuracy = 
  * Logistic Regression: Accuracy = 
  * SVM: Accuracy = 
  * K-Nearest Neighbors: Accuracy = 
  * Gradient Boosting Classifier: Accuracy = 


## 2a)  Open challenges and questions (including what -- if anything -- are the challenges that Ethan or I can help provide feedback or pointers on?)



## 2b)  Major changes to research plan (if any, based on what you've learned or accomplished thus far, and the unexpected challenges you've faced this week)



## 3) Revised week-by-week timeline (this can be copy and pasted exactly from what you previously had if there are no changes, but assuming you are doing some course corrections along the way, it's good to have a revised timeline to refer to!)
