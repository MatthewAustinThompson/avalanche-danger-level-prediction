# Week #5 Check In

## 1a)  Major activities/milestones planned for this week (in the timeline that you had going into the start of the week).

* Completed optimized feature engineering
* Completed optimized model implementation
* Completed data and model analysis


## 1b)  Major activities/milestones accomplished this week (note: this may or may not actually be what was stated in 1a -- that's okay, as long as you're making progress and learning!).

* Lowell completed the statistical comparison of the models
* Lowell also started the creation of the presentation
* Matthew completed the feature engineering, feature selection, and model implementation
* The new accuracy scores for each of the models are:
  * Decision Trees: Accuracy = 74%
  * Random Forest: Accuracy = 81%
  * Extra Trees: Accuracy = 80%
  * Logistic Regression: Accuracy = 61%
  * SVM: Accuracy = 76%
  * Gradient Boosting Classifier: Accuracy = 80%


## 2a)  Open challenges and questions (including what -- if anything -- are the challenges that Ethan or I can help provide feedback or pointers on?)
* Our models may be overfitting, but considering we are using multi-class classifiers it is a bit more tricky to determine than usual. We will solve this issue and report on it in our presentation


## 2b)  Major changes to research plan (if any, based on what you've learned or accomplished thus far, and the unexpected challenges you've faced this week)
* No major changes


## 3) Revised week-by-week timeline (this can be copy and pasted exactly from what you previously had if there are no changes, but assuming you are doing some course corrections along the way, it's good to have a revised timeline to refer to!)

November 22 â€“ Check-In #5:
* Completed optimized feature engineering
* Completed optimized model implementation
* Completed data and model analysis

November 29 - Project Due Date:
* Completed visualizing results
* Completed presentation
