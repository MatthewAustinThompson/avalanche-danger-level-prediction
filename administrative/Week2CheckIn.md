Matthew Thompson and Lowell Deschenes

# Week #2 Check In

## 1a)  Major activities/milestones planned for this week (in the timeline that you had going into the start of the week).

* Complete data cleaning process
* Merge the snow and weather data into one dataframe
* Scrape the avalanche occurrence data
* Create useful visualizations of our data/begin data exploration


## 1b)  Major activities/milestones accomplished this week (note: this may or may not actually be what was stated in 1a -- that's okay, as long as you're making progress and learning!).

* Lowell Completed the data cleaning process
* Lowell Merged the snow and weather data into one dataframe
* Matthew scraped the avalanche occurrence data
* Matthew created useful visualizations of our data/began data exploration


## 2a)  Open challenges and questions (including what -- if anything -- are the challenges that Ethan or I can help provide feedback or pointers on?)

The scraped avalanche occurrence data was not comprehensive enough to make a model from it so we have to switch up our goals. 


## 2b)  Major changes to research plan (if any, based on what you've learned or accomplished thus far, and the unexpected challenges you've faced this week)

We are going to instead build a multi class classification model to predict next day avalanche danger level.


## 3) Revised week-by-week timeline (this can be copy and pasted exactly from what you previously had if there are no changes, but assuming you are doing some course corrections along the way, it's good to have a revised timeline to refer to!)

November 1 – Check-In #2:

November 15 – Check-In #3:
