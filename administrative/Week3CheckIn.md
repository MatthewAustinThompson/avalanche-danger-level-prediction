# Week #3 Check In

## 1a)  Major activities/milestones planned for this week (in the timeline that you had going into the start of the week).

* Complete data exploration
* Complete preliminary feature selection
* Start model implementation


## 1b)  Major activities/milestones accomplished this week (note: this may or may not actually be what was stated in 1a -- that's okay, as long as you're making progress and learning!).

* Lowell completed the data exploration
* Lowell and Matthew worked together to complete the preliminary feature selection
* Lowell implemented out-of-the-box models
  * Decision Trees: Accuracy =
  * Random Forest: Accuracy =
  * Extra Trees: Accuracy =
* Matthew implemented out-of-the-box models
  * Logistic Regression: Accuracy = 54%
  * SVM: Accuracy = 38%
  * K-Nearest Neighbors: Accuracy = 44%
  * Gradient Boosting Classifier: Accuracy = 62%


## 2a)  Open challenges and questions (including what -- if anything -- are the challenges that Ethan or I can help provide feedback or pointers on?)

* An obvious open challenge is our currently low accuracy scores, however, these will improve with feature engineering and model optimization
* Dealing with null-values has been tricky so far because there are widespread gaps in our snow data that has forced us to not include some features that would likely be helpful to the model


## 2b)  Major changes to research plan (if any, based on what you've learned or accomplished thus far, and the unexpected challenges you've faced this week)

* None


## 3) Revised week-by-week timeline (this can be copy and pasted exactly from what you previously had if there are no changes, but assuming you are doing some course corrections along the way, it's good to have a revised timeline to refer to!)
