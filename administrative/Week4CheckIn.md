# Week #4 Check In

## 1a)  Major activities/milestones planned for this week (in the timeline that you had going into the start of the week).

*Completed feature engineering
*Completed model implementation


## 1b)  Major activities/milestones accomplished this week (note: this may or may not actually be what was stated in 1a -- that's okay, as long as you're making progress and learning!).

* Lowell completed preliminary model optimization
  * He implemented random search cross validation for each of the models to find the optimal hyperparameters. Fine tuning can still be done.
* Matthew completed preliminary feature engineering
  * He created a new feature for the next days avalanche danger so we can use it as what we wish to predict
  * He also created new features of the last 3 days weather and snow features for each day to hopefully improve the accuracy of the model
* The new accuracy scores for each of the models are
  * Decision Trees: Accuracy = 56%
  * Random Forest: Accuracy = 61%
  * Extra Trees: Accuracy = 61%
  * Logistic Regression: Accuracy = 63%
  * SVM: Accuracy = 63%
  * K-Nearest Neighbors: Accuracy = 57%
  * Gradient Boosting Classifier: Accuracy = 60%




## 2a)  Open challenges and questions (including what -- if anything -- are the challenges that Ethan or I can help provide feedback or pointers on?)

* An obvious open challenge is our currently low accuracy scores, however, these will improve with feature engineering and model optimization


## 2b)  Major changes to research plan (if any, based on what you've learned or accomplished thus far, and the unexpected challenges you've faced this week)

*


## 3) Revised week-by-week timeline (this can be copy and pasted exactly from what you previously had if there are no changes, but assuming you are doing some course corrections along the way, it's good to have a revised timeline to refer to!)
