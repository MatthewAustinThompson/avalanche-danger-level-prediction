1a)  Major activities/milestones planned for this week (in the timeline that you had going into the start of the week).


1b)  Major activities/milestones accomplished this week (note: this may or may not actually be what was stated in 1a -- that's okay, as long as you're making 
progress and learning!).


2a)  Open challenges and questions (including what -- if anything -- are the challenges that Ethan or I can help provide feedback or pointers on?)


2b)  Major changes to research plan (if any, based on what you've learned or accomplished thus far, and the unexpected challenges you've faced this week)


3) Revised week-by-week timeline (this can be copy and pasted exactly from what you previously had if there are no changes, but assuming you are doing some 
course corrections along the way, it's good to have a revised timeline to refer to!)
